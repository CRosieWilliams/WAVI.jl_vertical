Construct a WAVI.jl CGrid with size (Nx,Ny)
CGrid stores operators required for the CGrid. 
(Co-ordinates of CGrid stored in a Grid under xxc and yyc fields)

Keyword arguments
=================
- 'Nx': (required) Number of grid cells in x-direction in CGrid (should be same as grid.nx -1)
        Note that we store the grid size here, even though it can be easily inferred from grid, to increase transparency in velocity solve.
- 'Ny': (required) Number of grid cells in y-direction in CGrid (should be same as grid.ny - 1)
- 'mask': Mask specifying the model domain with respect to C grid
