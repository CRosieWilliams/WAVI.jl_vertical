# MISMIP+ example (part 2)
In this example, we demonstrate the retreat experiments performed in the Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison (MISMIP) (doi: 10.5194/tc-14-2283-2020). There experiments are as follows: starting from a steady state determined in MISMIP+ part 1, we enforce melt induced (ice 1r experiment) and calving induced (ice 2r experiment) for 100 years.

This example demonstrates how to:
    * apply simple parametrizations of ice shelf basal melting
    * chain simulations via ice thickness
