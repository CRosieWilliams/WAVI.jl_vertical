# # Ice Flow over a bed with variable slipperiness and viscosity.

# In this example, we consider flow in two horizontal dimensions, with variable ice viscosity and basal slipperiness. 
# This example is similar in spirit to the MISMIP 3D Intercomparison exercise (http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/)
# This example demonstrates how to apply spatially heterogenous basal slipperiness and ice viscosity fields.
